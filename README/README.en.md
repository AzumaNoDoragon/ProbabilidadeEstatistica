# Statistical Analysis with R

This repository contains **notes** and **fictitious data files** used during the **Probability and Statistics** course.

The code is not split into multiple files or exercises. Instead, everything is centralized in a single file called **`Anotacoes.R`**, which includes various types of analyses and inferences, each clearly named. If you're learning Probability and Statistics with R, this material can serve as a **practical guide** to quickly find how to apply, for example, a *correlation test*, a *boxplot*, or a *confidence interval*.
